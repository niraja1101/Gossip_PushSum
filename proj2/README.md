The program in the end will give the time for convergence for all the nodes together.INSTRUCTIONSThe name of the submitted zip file is niraja_harshal.zip, unzip this fileand go into the unzipped folder. Here, go into the folder proj2.To run the application, open a terminal in the folder "proj2". This is the application root directory of the Mix project created.On the terminal, the application can be built with the command :  mix escipt.buildRunTo run, enter the command escript proj2 <numberofnodes> <topology> <algorithm>1.    numberofnodes can be  any natural number2.    topology is one of  : full , line, impline ,rand2D,3D,torus3.    algorithm is one of : gossip,push-sumWHAT IS WORKING 1.	All topologies have been implemented successfully for both algorithms2.	For the gossip algorithm, we see 100 per cent convergence for all the topologies 3.	The random 2D topology may face trouble for a small number of nodes while running the Gossip algorithm since with lesser nodes distributed over a [0-1.0] X [0-1.0] grid it is possible that a node may not have a neighbor within 0.1 distance.4.	In the push-sum algorithm, we see convergence for all the topologies5.	The line topology may have a hard time converging for a large number of nodes since a node for which all neighbors have converged will be starved forever or due to deadlocks6.	Push-sum as an algorithm takes more time to converge than gossip since it takes longer for the sum to propagate from one end of the network to anotherLARGEST NETWORK MANAGED1.	For Gossipa.

For Line network, the maximum converged input was 1000k.	For Random 2D network, the maximum converged input was 10000l.	For 3D the maximum converged input was 100000
